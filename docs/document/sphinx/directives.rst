Directives
==========

reStructuredText can be expanded with `Directives
<https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html>`_.
Sphinx makes extensive use of this. Here are some examples:

.. glossary::

   environment
       A structure where information about all documents under the root is
       saved, and used for cross-referencing.  The environment is pickled
       after the parsing stage, so that successive runs only need to read
       and parse new and changed documents.

   source directory
       The directory which, including its subdirectories, contains all
       source files for one Sphinx project.
