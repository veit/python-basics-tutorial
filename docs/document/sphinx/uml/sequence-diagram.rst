``->``
    is used to draw a message between two actors. The actors do not have to be
    declared explicitly.
``-->``
     is used to draw a dotted line.
``<-`` and ``<--``
    do not change the drawing, but may increase readability.

    .. note::
       This applies only to sequence diagrams. In other diagrams other rules may
       apply.
