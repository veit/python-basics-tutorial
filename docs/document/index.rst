Document
========

In order for your software package to be useful, documentation is required that
describes how your software can be installed, operated, used and improved:

* Those who want to use your package need information,

  * what problems your software solves and what the main features and
    limitations of the software are (``README``)
  * how the software can be used as an example
  * what changes have come in more recent software versions (``CHANGELOG``)

* Those who want to run the software need an installation guide for your
  software and the required dependencies.

* Those who want to improve the software need information about

  * how to help improve the product with bug fixes (``CONTRIBUTING``)
  * how to communicate with others (``CODE_OF_CONDUCT``)

All together need information on how the product is licensed (``LICENSE`` file
or ``LICENSES`` folder) and how to get help if needed.
