``print()``
===========

The function :func:`print` outputs character strings, whereby other Python data
types can easily be converted into strings and formatted, for example:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> import math
   >>> pi = math.pi
   >>> d = 28
   >>> u = pi * d
   >>> print(
   ...     "Pi is",
   ...     pi,
   ...     "and the circumference with a diameter of",
   ...     d,
   ...     "inches is",
   ...     u,
   ...     "inches.",
   ... )
   Pi is 3.141592653589793 and the circumference with a diameter of 28 inches is 87.96459430051421 inches.

F-Strings
---------

F-strings can be used to shorten numbers that are too detailed for a text:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> print(f"The value of Pi is {pi:.3f}.")
    The value of Pi is 3.142.

In ``{pi:.3f}``, the format specification ``f`` is used to truncate the number
Pi to three decimal places.

In A/B test scenarios, you often want to display the percentage change in a key
figure. F strings can be used to formulate them in an understandable way:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> metrics = 0.814172
   >>> print(f"The AUC has increased to {metrics:=+7.2%}")
   The AUC has increased to +81.42%

In this example, the variable ``metrics`` is formatted with ``=`` taking over
the contents of the variable after the ``+``, displaying a total of seven
characters including the plus or minus sign, ``metrics`` and the percent sign.
``.2`` provides two decimal places, while the ``%`` symbol converts the decimal
value into a percentage. For example, ``0.514172`` is converted to ``+51.42%``.

Values can also be converted into binary and hexadecimal values:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> block_size = 192
   >>> print(f"Binary block size: {block_size:b}")
   Binary block size: 11000000
   >>> print(f"Hex block size: {block_size:x}")
   Hex block size: c0

There are also formatting specifications that are ideally suited for :abbr:`CLI
(Command Line Interface)` output, for example:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> data_types = [(7, "Data types", 19), (7.1, "Numbers", 19), (7.2, "Lists", 23)]
   >>> for n, title, page in data_types:
   ...     print(f"{n:.1f} {title:.<25} {page: >3}")
   ...
   7.0 Data types...............  19
   7.1 Numbers..................  19
   7.2 Lists....................  23

In general, the format is as follows, whereby all information in square brackets
is optional:

:samp:`:[[FILL]ALIGN][SIGN][0b|0o|0x|d|n][0][WIDTH][GROUPING]["." PRECISION][TYPE]`

The following table lists the fields for character string formatting and their

+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

.. [#] The format identifier ``n`` formats a number in a locally customised way,
    for example:

    .. code-block:: pycon

       >>> value = 635372
       >>> import locale
       >>> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_NUMERIC, "en_US.utf-8")
       'en_US.utf-8'
       >>> print(f"{value:n}")
       635,372

.. tip::
   A good source for F-strings is the help function:

   .. code-block:: pycon

      >>> help()
      help> FORMATTING
      ...

   You can browse through the help here and find many examples.

   You can exit the help function again with :kbd:`:`–:kbd:`q` and :kbd:`⏎`.

   * :pep:`498`

Debugging F-Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Python 3.8, a specifier was introduced to help with debugging F-string
variables. By adding an equals sign ``=``, the code is included within the
F-string:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> uid = "veit"
   >>> print(f"My name is {uid.capitalize()=}")
   My name is uid.capitalize()='Veit'

Formatting date and time formats and IP addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:py:mod:`datetime` supports the formatting of strings using the same syntax as
the :py:meth:`strftime <datetime.datetime.strftime>` method for these objects.

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> import datetime
   >>> today = datetime.date.today()
   >>> print(f"Today is {today:%d %B %Y}.")
   Today is 26 November 2023.

The :py:mod:`ipaddress` module of Python also supports the formatting of
``IPv4Address`` and ``IPv6Address`` objects.

Finally, third-party libraries can also add their own support for formatting
strings by adding a ``__format__`` method to their objects.
