Installation
============

Installing Python can be easy. The first step is to download the latest version
from `www.python.org/downloads <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_. The
tutorial is based on Python 3.13.0, but if you have Python 3.8 or newer
installed, this should not be a problem.

.. tab:: Linux

   Python is already included in the `Linux Standard Base
   <https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/lsb/start>`_. However, most Linux
   distributions do not want to have anything to do with the language-specific
   package manager, but want to manage everything via ``rpm``/``deb`` or
   similar. package managers :abbr:`etc (et cetera)`. They also donâ€™t want their
   packages to be used for anything other than system purposes. You should
   therefore install your own Python. Under Ubuntu, for example, you can do this
   with:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.4/Python-3.13.0.tgz
      $ tar xf Python-3.13.0.tgz
      $ cd Python-3.13.0
      $ ./configure --enable-optimizations
      $ sudo make altinstall

   .. warning::
      One disadvantage is that you have to return to the website regularly to
      check for security updates as there is no integrated auto-updater.

   If older Python versions are required, for example to test libraries with
   :doc:`test/tox`, we use `deadsnakes
   <https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa>`_.

.. tab:: macOS

   You can obtain Python directly from https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/.
   The ``universal2`` installers also run on Intel-based environments.

   One disadvantage is that you have to return to the website regularly to check
   for security updates, as there is no integrated auto-updater. Alternatively,
   you can install `MOPUp <https://pypi.org/project/MOPUp/>`_ with ``python -m
   pip install MOPUp`` and then regularly call ``mopup`` to get the latest
   version of your Python installation.

   If older Python versions are required, for example to test libraries with
   :doc:`test/tox`, `python-build-standalone
   <https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/python-build-standalone/main/building.html#macos>`_
   can be used.

.. tab:: Windows

   Python can be installed for most Windows versions after Windows 7 with the
   Python installer in three steps:

   #. Download the latest Python Releases for Windows installer, for example
      `Windows installer (64-bit)
      <https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.0/python-3.13.0-amd64.exe>`_.
   #. Start the installation programme. If you have the necessary
      authorisations, install Python with the option *Install launcher for all
      users*. This should install Python in
      :file:`C:\\Program Files\\Python313-64`. In addition, *Add Python 3.13 to
      PATH* should be activated so that this path to the Python installation is
      also entered in the list of ``PATH`` environment variables.
   #. Finally, you can now check the installation by entering the following in
      the command prompt:

      .. code-block:: ps1con

         C:\> python -V
         Python 3.13.0

      .. warning::
         One disadvantage is that you have to return to the website regularly to
         check for security updates, as there is no integrated auto-updater.

.. tip::
   `direnv <https://direnv.net>`_ allows you to set environment variables
   depending on the directory. This allows you to install environment variables
   from `The twelve-factor apps <https://12factor.net>`_ and project-specific
   environments as well as providing secrets for deployment.
