Doctest
=======

The Python module :doc:`doctest <python3:library/doctest>` checks whether tests
in a docstring or in another text file are fulfilled.

#. In :download:`arithmetic.py` you can add the following docstring:

   .. literalinclude:: arithmetic.py
      :language: python
      :lines: 9-18
      :lineno-start: 9

#. Then you can test it with:

   .. tab:: Linux/macOS

      .. code-block:: console

        $ python -m doctest test/arithmetic.py -v
        Trying:
            add(7,6)
        Expecting:
            13
        ok
        Trying:
            x, y, z = 7, -6.0, 0
        Expecting nothing
        ok
        Trying:
            divide(x, y)

        ok
        Trying:
            divide(x, z)

        ok
        Trying:
            multiply(7,6)
        Expecting:
            42
        ok
        Trying:
            subtract(7,6)
        Expecting:
            1
        ok
        1 items had no tests:

        4 items passed all tests:

           3 tests in arithmetic.divide
           1 tests in arithmetic.multiply
           1 tests in arithmetic.subtract
        6 tests in 5 items.
        6 passed and 0 failed.
        Test passed.

        6 tests in 5 items.
        6 passed and 0 failed.
        Test passed.

#. So that the doctests can also be imported into other modules, you should add
   the following lines:

   .. literalinclude:: arithmetic.py
      :language: python
      :lines: 38-
      :lineno-start: 38

.. seealso::
   :doc:`doctest <python3:library/doctest>` also has the ability to execute
   tests in your documentation: :ref:`Document → Testing → Code <test_code>`.
