Control flow
============

Python has a whole range of :term:`control flows <Control flow>` to control code
execution and programme flow, including common branches and loops:

:doc:`boolean`
    check values and identity and allow links between the two.
:doc:`conditional`
    execute the code block after the first true condition of an ``if`` or
    ``elif`` statement; if neither condition is true, the code block is executed
    after the ``else``.
:doc:`loops`
    While ``while`` loops are executed as long as the condition is true, ``for``
    loops iterate over :doc:`../types/sequences-sets/lists`,
    :doc:`../types/sequences-sets/tuples` and
    :doc:`../types/sequences-sets/sets`.
:doc:`exceptions`
    usually deal with errors that occur during the execution of programmes.
:doc:`with`
    regulates access to files, the locking of threads and the suppression of
    :doc:`exceptions`, among other things.
