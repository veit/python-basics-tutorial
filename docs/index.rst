Python basics
=============

Welcome to Python Basics! I have written this book to provide an easy and
practical introduction to Python. The book is not intended to be a comprehensive
reference guide to Python, but rather the goal is to give you a basic
familiarity with Python and enable you to quickly write your own programs.

   If you have suggestions for improvements, I would be happy to :doc:`receive
   <contribute>` them.
