   build
       ``build`` is a :pep:`517`-compatible Python package builder. It provides
       a CLI for building packages and a Python API.

   built distribution
   bdist
       A structure of files and metadata that only needs to be moved to the
       correct location on the target system during installation. :term:`wheel`
       is such a format, but not *distutils* :term:`Source Distribution` that
       require a build step.

   cibuildwheel
       :doc:`/libs/cibuildwheel` is a Python package that creates :term:`wheels
       <wheel>` for all common platforms and Python versions on most CI systems.

   conda
       Package management tool for the `Anaconda
       <https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index.html>`_ distribution from
       `Continuum Analytics <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_. It’s specifically
       aimed at the scientific community, particularly Windows, where installing
       binary extensions is often difficult.

       Conda does not install packages from PyPI and can only install from the
       official Continuum repositories or from `anaconda.org
       <https://anaconda.org/>`_ or local ( e.g. intranet) package servers.
       Note, however, that Pip can be installed in conda and can work side by
       side to manage distributions of PyPI.

   distribution package
       A versioned archive file that contains Python :term:`packages <import
       package>`, :term:`modules <module>`, and other resource files used to
       distribute a :term:`release`.

   distutils
       Python standard library package that provides support for bootstrapping
       :term:`pip` into an existing Python installation or :term:`virtual
       environment`.

   egg
       A :term:`built distribution` format introduced by :term:`setuptools`
       that is now being replaced by :term:`wheel`. For more information, see
       `The Internal Structure of Python Eggs
       <https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/deprecated/python_eggs.html>`_

   enscons
       enscons is a Python packaging tool based on `SCons <https://scons.org>`_.
       It builds :term:`pip`-compatible :term:`source distributions <source
       distribution>` and :term:`wheels <wheel>` without using :term:`distutils`
       or :term:`setuptools`, including distributions with C extensions. enscons
       has a different architecture and philosophy than :term:`distutils`, as it
       adds Python packaging to a general build system. enscons can help you
       build :term:`sdists <sdist>` and :term:`wheels <wheel>`.

   Flit
       Flit provides an easy way to build pure Python packages and modules and
       upload them to the :term:`Python Package Index`. Flit can generate a
       configuration file to quickly set up a project, create a :term:`source
       distribution` and :term:`wheel`, and upload them to PyPI.

       Flit uses :term:`pyproject.toml` to configure a project. Flit does not
       rely on tools like :term:`setuptools` to create distributions, or on
       :term:`twine` to upload them to :term:`PyPI`.
