Creating a distribution package
===============================

:term:`Distribution Packages <Distribution Package>` are archives that can be
uploaded to a package index such as :term:`pypi.org` and installed with
:term:`pip`.

Some of the following commands require a new version of pip, so you should make
sure you have the latest version installed:


.. tab:: Linux/macOS

   .. code-block:: console

      $ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

.. tab:: Windows

   .. code-block:: ps1

      > python  -m pip install --upgrade pip

Structure
---------

A minimal distribution package can look like this, for example:

.. code-block:: console

    dataprep
    ├── pyproject.toml
    └── src
        └── dataprep
            ├── __init__.py
            └── loaders.py

.. _pyproject-toml:

:file:`pyproject.toml`
----------------------

:pep:`517` and :pep:`518` brought extensible build backends, isolated builds and
`pyproject.toml
<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/>`_ in
:doc:`Python4DataScience:data-processing/serialisation-formats/toml/index`
format.

Among other things, :file:`pyproject.toml` tells :term:`pip` and :term:`build`
which backend tool to use to build distribution packages for your project. You
can choose from a number of backends, though this tutorial uses ``hatchling`` by
default.

A minimal yet functional :download:`dataprep/pyproject.toml` file will then look
like this, for example:

.. code-block:: toml
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 1

   [build-system]
   requires = ["hatchling"]
   build-backend = "hatchling.build"

``build-system``
    defines a section describing the build system
``requires``
    defines a list of dependencies that must be installed for the build system
    to work, in our case ``hatchling``.

    .. note::
       Dependency version numbers should usually be written in the
       `requirements.txt
       <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files>`_ file,
       not here.

``build-backend``
    identifies the entry point for the build-backend object as a dotted path.
    The ``hatchling`` backend object is available under ``hatchling.build``.

    .. note::
       However, for Python packages that contain binary extensions with
       ``Cython``, ``C``, ``C++``, ``Fortran`` or ``Rust``, the
       :term:`hatchling` backend is not suitable. One of the following backends
       should be used here:

       * :term:`setuptools`
       * :term:`scikit-build`
       * :term:`maturin`

       But thatr’s not all – there are other backends:

       * :term:`Flit`
       * :term:`whey`
       * :term:`poetry`
       * :term:`pybind11`
       * :term:`meson-python`

    .. seealso::
       * `pypackaging-native <https://pypackaging-native.github.io>`_

.. note::
   With `validate-pyproject
   <https://validate-pyproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ you can check your
   :file:`pyproject.toml` file.

.. seealso::
   If you want to look at alternatives to ``hatchling``:

   * :term:`setuptools`
   * :term:`Flit`
   * `poetry <https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry>`_
   * `pypackaging-native <https://pypackaging-native.github.io>`_

Metadata
~~~~~~~~

In :file:`pyproject.toml` you can also specify metadata for your package, such
as:

.. literalinclude:: dataprep/pyproject.toml
   :language: toml
   :lines: 5-19, 21-23, 40-
   :lineno-start: 5

``name``
    is the distribution name of your package. This can be any name as long as it
    contains only letters, numbers, ``.``, ``_`` and ``-``. It should also not
    already be assigned on the :term:`Python Package Index` (:term:`PyPI`).
``version``
    is the version of the package.

    In our example, the version number has been set statically. However, there
    is also the possibility to specify the version dynamically, for example by a
    file:

    .. code-block:: toml

       [project]
       ...
       dynamic = ["version"]
       [tool.hatch.version]
       path = "src/dataprep/__about__.py"

    The default pattern looks for a variable called :samp:`__version__` or
    :samp:`VERSION`, which contains the version, optionally preceded by the
    lower case letter :samp:`v`. The default pattern is based on :pep:`440`.

    If this is not the way you want to store versions, you can define a
    different regular expression with the :samp:`pattern` option.

    .. seealso::
       * `Calendar Versioning <https://calver.org>`_
       * `ZeroVer <https://0ver.org/>`_

    However, there are other version scheme plug-ins, such as `hatch-semver
    <https://github.com/fleetingbytes/hatch-semver>`_ for `semantic Versioning
    <https://semver.org>`_.

    With the version source plugin `hatch-vcs
    <https://github.com/ofek/hatch-vcs>`_ you can also use
    :doc:`Python4DataScience:productive/git/tag`:

    .. code-block:: toml

       [build-system]
       requires = ["hatchling", "hatch-vcs"]
       ...
       [tool.hatch.version]
       source = "vcs"
       raw-options = { local_scheme = "no-local-version" }

    The setuptools backend also allows dynamic versioning:

    .. code-block:: toml

       [build-system]
       requires = ["setuptools>=61.0", "setuptools-scm"]
       build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
       [project]
       ...
       dynamic = ["version"]
       [tool.setuptools.dynamic]
       version = {attr = "dataprep.VERSION"}

    .. seealso::
       * `Configuring setuptools using pyproject.toml files: Dynamic Metadata
         <https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html#dynamic-metadata>`_

``authors``
    is used to identify the authors of the package by name and email address.

    You can also list ``maintainers`` in the same format.

``description``
    is a short summary of the package, consisting of one sentence.
``readme``
    is a path to a file containing a detailed description of the package. This
    is displayed on the package details page on :term:`Python Package Index`
    (:term:`PyPI`). In this case, the description is loaded from ``README.rst``.
``requires-python``
    specifies the versions of Python that are supported by your project. This
    will cause installers like :term:`pip` to search through older versions of
    packages until they find one that has a matching Python version.
``classifiers``
    gives the :term:`Python Package Index` (:term:`PyPI`) and :term:`pip` some
    additional metadata about your package. In this case, the package is only
    compatible with Python 3, is under the BSD licence and is OS independent.
    You should always at least specify the versions of Python your package runs
    under, under which licence your package is available and on which operating
    systems your package runs. You can find a complete list of classifiers at
    https://pypi.org/classifiers/.

    They also have a useful additional feature: to prevent a package from being
    uploaded to :term:`PyPI`, use the special classifier ``"Private :: Do Not
    Upload"``. :term:`PyPI` will always reject packages whose classifier starts
    with ``"Private ::"``.

``dependencies``
    gibt die Abhängigkeiten für euer Paket in einem Array an.

    .. seealso::
       :pep:`631`

``urls``
    lets you list any number of additional links that are displayed on the
    :term:`Python Package Index` (:term:`PyPI`). In general, this could lead to
    source code, documentation, task managers, :abbr:`etc (et cetera)`.

.. seealso::
   * `Declaring project metadata
     <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/#declaring-project-metadata-the-project-table>`_
   * :pep:`345`

Optional dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``project.optional-dependencies``
    allows you to specify optional dependencies for your package. You can also
    distinguish between different sets:

.. literalinclude:: dataprep/pyproject.toml
   :language: toml
   :lines: 24-34
   :lineno-start: 34

Recursive optional dependencies are also possible with pip ≥ 21.2. For example,
for ``dev`` you can take over all dependencies from ``docs`` and ``test`` in
addition to ``pre-commit``:

.. literalinclude:: dataprep/pyproject.toml
   :language: toml
   :lines: 35-39
   :lineno-start: 35

You can install these optional dependencies, for example with:

.. tab:: Linux/macOS

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cd /PATH/TO/YOUR/DISTRIBUTION_PACKAGE
      $ python3 -m venv .
      $ . bin/activate
      $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      $ python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'

.. tab:: Windows

   .. code-block:: ps1

      > cd C:\PATH\TO\YOUR\DISTRIBUTION_PACKAGE
      > python3 -m venv .
      > Scripts\activate.bat
      > python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      > python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'

:file:`src` package
-------------------

When you create a new package, you shouldn’t use a flat layout but the
:file:`src` layout, which is also recommended in `Packaging Python Projects
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/>`_ of the
:term:`PyPA`. A major advantage of this layout is that tests are run with the
installed version of your package and not with the files in your working
directory.

.. seealso::
   * Hynek Schlawack: `Testing & Packaging
     <https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/package-structure-code/python-package-structure.html>`_

.. note::
   In Python ≥ 3.11 :envvar:`PYTHONSAFEPATH` can be used to ensure that the
   installed packages are used first.

:file:`dataprep`
    is the directory that contains the Python files. The name should match the
    project name to simplify configuration and be more recognisable to those
    installing the package.
:file:`__init__.py`
    is required to import the directory as a package. The file should be empty.
:file:`loaders.py`
    is an example of a module within the package that could contain the logic
    (functions, classes, constants, :abbr:`etc. (et cetera)`) of your package.

Other files
-----------

:file:`CONTRIBUTORS.rst`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. seealso::
    * `All contributors <https://allcontributors.org/>`_

:file:`LICENSE`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can find detailed information on this in the
:doc:`Python4DataScience:productive/licensing` section.

:file:`README.rst`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file briefly tells those who are interested in the package how to use it.

.. seealso::
    * `Make a README <https://www.makeareadme.com>`_
    * `readme.so <https://readme.so>`_

If you write the document in :doc:`/document/rest`, you can also include the
contents as a detailed description in your package:

.. literalinclude:: dataprep/pyproject.toml
   :language: toml
   :lineno-start: 5
   :lines: 5, 12

You can also include them in your :doc:`Sphinx documentation </document/start>`
with ``.. include:: ../../README.rst``.

Historical files or files needed for binary extensions
------------------------------------------------------

Before the :file:`pyproject.toml` file introduced with :pep:`518` became the
standard, ``setuptools`` required :file:`setup.py`, :file:`setup.cfg` and
:file:`MANIFEST.in`. Today, however, these files are only needed for
:doc:`binary extensions <binary-extensions>` at best.

If you want to replace these files in your packages, you can do so with ``hatch
new --init`` or `ini2toml
<https://ini2toml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools_pep621.html>`_.

:file:`setup.py`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A minimal and yet functional :download:`dataprep/setup.py` can look like this,
for example:

.. literalinclude:: dataprep/setup.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:

`package_dir
<https://docs.python.org/3.11/distutils/setupscript.html#listing-whole-packages>`_
points to the ``src`` directory, which can contain one or more packages. You can
then use setuptools’s `find_packages()
<https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/package_discovery.html#finding-simple-packages>`_
to find all packages in this directory.

.. note::
    ``find_packages()`` without ``src/`` directory would package all directories
    with a ``__init__.py`` file, so also ``tests/`` directories.

:file:`setup.cfg`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file is no longer needed, at least not for packaging. ``wheel`` nowadays
collects all required licence files automatically and ``setuptools`` can build
universal ``wheel`` packages with the ``options`` keyword argument, for example
:file:`dataprep-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`.

.. _manifest-in:

:file:`MANIFEST.in`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file contains all files and directories that are not already covered by
``packages`` or ``py_module``. It can look like this:
:download:`dataprep/MANIFEST.in`:

.. literalinclude:: dataprep/MANIFEST.in
   :linenos:

For more instructions in :file:`Manifest.in`, see `MANIFEST.in commands
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/using-manifest-in/>`__.

.. note::
   People often forget to update the :file:`Manifest.in` file. To avoid this,
   you can use `check-manifest <https://pypi.org/project/check-manifest/>`_ in a
   pre-commit hook.

.. note::
   If you want files and directories from :file:`MANIFEST.in` to be installed as
   well, for example if they are runtime-relevant data, you can specify this
   with ``include_package_data=True`` in your ``setup()`` call.

Build
-----

The next step is to create distribution packages for the package. These are
archives that can be uploaded to the :term:`Python Package Index` (:term:`PyPI`)
and installed by :term:`pip`.

Make sure you have the latest version of ``build`` installed:

Now run the command in the same directory where :file:`pyproject.toml` is
located:

.. tab:: Linux/macOS

   .. code-block:: console

      $ python -m pip install build
      $ cd /PATH/TO/YOUR/DISTRIBUTION_PACKAGE
      $ rm -rf build dist
      $ python -m build

.. tab:: Windows

   .. code-block:: ps1

      > python -m pip install build
      > cd C:\PATH\TO\YOUR\DISTRIBUTION_PACKAGE
      > rm -rf build dist
      > python -m build

The second line ensures that a clean build is created without artefacts from
previous builds. The third line should output a lot of text and create two files
in the ``dist`` directory when finished:

.. code-block:: console

   dist
   ├── dataprep-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
   └── dataprep-0.1.0.tar.gz

:file:`dataprep-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`
    is a binary distribution format with the suffix :file:`..whl`, where the
    filename is composed as follows:

    ``dataprep``
        is the normalised package name
    ``0.1.0``
        is the version of the distribution package
    ``py3``
        specifies the Python version and, if applicable, the C-`ABI
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface>`_
    ``none``
        specifies whether the :term:`Wheel` package is suitable for any OS or
        only specific ones
    ``any``
        ``any`` is suitable for any processor architecture, ``x86_64`` on the
        other hand only for chips with the x86 instruction set and a 64-bit
        architecture

:file:`dataprep-0.1.0.tar.gz`
    is a :term:`source distribution`.

.. seealso::
   The reference for the file names can be found in `File name convention
   <https://peps.python.org/pep-0427/#file-name-convention>`_.

   For more information on ``sdist``, see `Creating a Source Distribution
   <https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/sourcedist.html#creating-a-source-distribution>`__
   and :pep:`376`.

Testing
-------

.. tab:: Linux/macOS

   .. code-block:: console

      $ mkdir test_env
      $ cd test_env
      $ python3 -m venv .
      $ source bin/activate
      $ python -m pip install dist/dataprep-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
      Processing ./dist/dataprep-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
      Collecting pandas
        Using cached pandas-1.3.4-cp39-cp39-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl (11.6 MB)
      …
      Successfully installed dataprep-0.1.0 numpy-1.21.4 pandas-1.3.4 python-dateutil-2.8.2 pytz-2021.3 six-1.16.0

.. tab:: Windows

   .. code-block:: console

      > mkdir test_env
      > cd test_env
      > python -m venv .
      > Scripts\activate.bat
      > python -m pip install dist/dataprep-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
      Processing ./dist/dataprep-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
      Collecting pandas

      Successfully installed dataprep-0.1.0 numpy-1.21.4 pandas-1.3.4 python-dateutil-2.8.2 pytz-2021.3 six-1.16.0

Anschließend könnt ihr die :term:`Wheel`-Datei überprüfen mit:

.. code-block:: console

    $ mkdir test_env
    $ cd !$
    cd test_env
    $ python3 -m venv .
    $ source bin/activate
    $ python -m pip install dist/dataprep-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
    Processing ./dist/dataprep-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
    Collecting pandas

    …
    Successfully installed dataprep-0.1.0 numpy-1.21.4 pandas-1.3.4 python-dateutil-2.8.2 pytz-2021.3 six-1.16.0

Then you can check the wheel with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m pip install check-wheel-contents
    $ check-wheel-contents dist/*.whl
    dist/dataprep-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl: OK

Alternatively, you can also install the package:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m pip install dist/dataprep-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
    Processing ./dist/dataprep-0.1-py3-none-any.whl
    Collecting pandas
    …
    Installing collected packages: numpy, pytz, six, python-dateutil, pandas, dataprep
    Successfully installed dataprep-0.1 numpy-1.21.4 pandas-1.3.4 python-dateutil-2.8.2 pytz-2021.3 six-1.16.0

You can then call Python and import your ``loaders`` module:

.. code-block:: python

    from dataprep import loaders

.. note::
   There are still many instructions that include a step to call
   :file:`setup.py`, for example :samp:`python setup.py sdist`. However, this is
   now considered `anti-pattern
   <https://x.com/pganssle/status/1152695229105000453>`_ by parts of the
   `Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) <https://github.com/pypa/>`_.
