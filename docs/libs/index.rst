Programme libraries
===================

Several :doc:`/modules/index` can be grouped together in a programme library.
Such libraries allow you to group modules into directories and subdirectories
and then import and hierarchically reference them using a
``package.subpackage.module`` syntax. This does not require much more than the
creation of a possibly empty initialisation file for each package or subpackage.
