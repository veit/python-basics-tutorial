Decorators
==========

Functions can also be passed as arguments to other functions and return the
results of other functions. For example, it is possible to write a Python
function that takes another function as a parameter, embeds it in another
function that does something similar, and then returns the new function. This
new combination can then be used instead of the original function:

.. code-block:: pycon
   :linenos:

    >>> def inf(func):
    ...     print("Information about", func.__name__)
    ...     def details(*args):
    ...         print("Execute function", func.__name__, "with the argument(s)")
    ...         return func(*args)
    ...     return details
    ...
    >>> def my_func(*params):
    ...     print(params)
    ...
    >>> my_func = inf(my_func)
    Information about my_func
    >>> my_func("Hello", "Pythonistas!")
    Execute function my_func with the argument(s)
    ('Hello', 'Pythonistas!')

Line 2
    The ``inf`` function outputs the name of the function it wraps.
Line 6
    When finished, the ``inf`` function returns the wrapped function.

A decorator is `syntactic sugar
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar>`_ for this process and allows
you to wrap one function inside another with a one-line addition. You still get
exactly the same effect as with the previous code, but the resulting code is
much cleaner and easier to read. Using a decorator simply consists of two parts:

#. the definition of the function to wrap or *decorate* other functions, and
#. the use of an ``@`` followed by the decorator just before the wrapped
   function is defined.

The decorator function should take a function as a parameter and return a
function, as follows:

.. code-block:: pycon
   :linenos:

    >>> @inf
    ... def my_func(*params):
    ...     print(params)
    ...
    Information about my_func
    >>> my_func("Hello", "Pythonistas!")
    Execute function my_func with the argument(s)
    ('Hello', 'Pythonistas!')

Line 1
    The function ``my_func`` is decorated with ``@inf``.
Line 7
    The wrapped function is called after the decorator function is finished.

``functools``
-------------

The Python :mod:`functools` module is intended for higher-order functions, for
example functions that act on or return other functions. Mostly you can use them
as decorators, such as:

:func:`functools.cache`
    Simple, lightweight, function cache as of Python â‰¥ 3.9, sometimes called
    *memoize*. It returns the same as :func:`functools.lru_cache` with the
    parameter ``maxsize=None``, additionally creating a :doc:`/types/dicts` with
    the function arguments. Since old values never need to be deleted, this
    function is then also smaller and faster. Example:

    .. code-block:: pycon
        :linenos:

        >>> from functools import cache
        >>> @cache
        ... def factorial(n):
        ...     return n * factorial(n - 1) if n else 1
        ...
        >>> factorial(8)
        40320
        >>> factorial(10)
        3628800

    Line 6
        Since there is no previously stored result, nine recursive calls are
        made.
    Line 8
        makes only two new calls, as the other results come from the cache.

:func:`functools.wraps`
    This decorator makes the wrapper function look like the original function
    with its name and properties.

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> from functools import wraps
        >>> def my_decorator(f):
        ...     @wraps(f)
        ...     def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        ...         """Wrapper docstring"""
        ...         print("Call decorated function")
        ...         return f(*args, **kwargs)
        ...     return wrapper
        ...
        >>> @my_decorator
        ... def example():
        ...     """Example docstring"""
        ...     print("Call example function")
        ...
        >>> example.__name__
        'example'
        >>> example.__doc__
        'Example docstring'

    Without ``@wraps`` decorator, the name and docstring of the wrapper method
    would have been returned instead:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> example.__name__
        'wrapper'
        >>> example.__doc__
        'Wrapper docstring'
