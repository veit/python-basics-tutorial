Installation
============

Requirements
------------

* Python interpreter

* Path to the base directory for your Python packages

  Make sure your ``bin`` bindirectory is in the path. Usually this is
  ``~/.local/`` for Linux and Mac OS or ``%APPDATA%\Python``. on Windows. You
  can find more information at `site.USER_BASE
  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#site.USER_BASE>`_.

  .. tab:: Linux/macOS

     For bash you can enter the path in your ``~/.bash_profile``:

     .. code-block:: bash

        export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH

     and then read the file with:

     .. code-block:: console

        $ source ~/.bash_profile

  .. tab:: Windows

     Make sure the directory where CookieCutter will be installed is in your
     ``Path`` so you can go directly to it. To do this, look for *Environment
     Variables* on your computer and add this directory to  ``Path``, for
     example ``%APPDATA%\Python\Python3x\Scripts``. Then you probably have to
     restart the session in order to be able to use the environment variables.
